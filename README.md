# Scraper2
Scrapping stock data preview

To Run - 
1. Clone the repo
2. View the samples in the FilmSupplyVideos and the videos_metadata.json (after this just delete the video directory and the json)
3. Run "python3 dataScrapper.py".
4. The user is prompted to enter either the number of stock videos they'd want to look at or enter ALL in case you want it to go through every stock video in the nature category on the website.
5. Script runs to populate a folder FilmSupplyVideos with the videos and a videos_metadata.json for the corresponding metadata.
