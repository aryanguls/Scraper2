Scrapping stock data preview

To Run - 
1. Clone the repo
2. Run "python3 dataScrapper.py" (after you have seen the samples you can also just delete the video directory and the json and run it to see how it populates per campaign).
3. The user is prompted to enter either the number of stock videos they'd want to look at or enter ALL in case you want it to go through every stock video in the nature category on the website.
4. Script runs to populate a folder FilmSupplyVideos with the videos and a videos_metadata.json for the corresponding metadata.
